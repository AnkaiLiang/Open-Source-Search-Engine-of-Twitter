# Open-Source-Search-Engine-of-Twitter
We used an open source search Engine(ElasticSearch) to search Twitter. And created a web server by node.js.  
## Description
In this project, we used the Twitter API, logstash and ElasticSearch to create a Twitter search feature based on geolocation. Our implementation was able to stream Tweets real-time from Twitter and index/store those tweets into ElasticSearch. The web application has a good interface for users to enter search information. Finally, this app was deployed on a cloud-platform.
